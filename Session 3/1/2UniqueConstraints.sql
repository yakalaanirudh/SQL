/*Unique constraints allow NULL but it will allow only once*/
/*The unique constraint is visible in keys in table data*/
/*If there is a Unique constraint we add multiple rows at once,even if one row is duplicated the entire data wont be entered into the table*/
/*We cant alter constraints like we alter tables*/
